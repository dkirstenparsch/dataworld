ok so

responses -> columns are each colour (1-93), so are rows. each cell is a comparison. this is the shit that was fed into slide 44 on my slides
predictedresponses -> responses but the cells have the euclidian distance between the two colours instead of the responses
hits -> responses except with how many times each cell was sampled
comparisoncoordinates -> responses but the contents of the cells is the row in comparisons that that cell corrosponds to
comparisons -> rgb values of the 4370 unique comparisons

results -> the measures i took from each participant
	participant: prolific id
	spearman and pearson: correlations between passes
	meanrt: mean reaction time
	medianrt: median of same
	meandiff: mean difference between passes
	meancatchrt: mean RT on catch trials
	mediancatchrt: median of same
	catchacc: percentage of catch trials they succeeded on
	predspear and predpears: correlations between participant responses and predicted response
